A simple, boilerplate plugin to prepare new installs of Wordpress with my preferred settings. I also use it as a framework to develop plugins and add WP customizations.

== Description ==

This plugin is used to adjust common settings and setup practices on a new WP installation. Options changed do not revert automatically so use with caution.

1. Disable avatars and comments site-wide
1. Disable xmlrpc for security purposes
1. Set media to store in single directory and NOT use Year/Month folders

== Installation ==

1. Upload the entire `cdesign-base-coat` folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
1. Activate this plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in your WordPress installation
