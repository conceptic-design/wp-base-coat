A simple, boilerplate plugin to prepare new installs of Wordpress with my preferred settings. I also use it as a framework to develop plugins and add WP customizations.

== Description ==

This plugin is used to adjust common settings and setup practices on a new WP installation. Options changed do not revert automatically so use with caution.

1. Removes month/year media folders, generator tags and xmlrpc
1. Disables comments, avatars and emojis across the website to save overhead
1. Hooks in place both back/frontend functionality and adding custom CSS/JS
1. Set the default editor view to HTML

== Installation ==

1. Upload the entire `cdesign-base-coat` folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
1. Activate this plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in your WordPress installation
