# WP Base Coat

A simple, boilerplate plugin to prepare new installs of Wordpress with my preferred settings. I also use it as a framework to develop plugins and add WP customizations to projects.

## Features

* Removes month/year media folders, generator tags and xmlrpc
* Disables blog functionality (comments, avatars and emojis) across the website to save overhead
* Hooks in place both back/frontend functionality and adding custom CSS/JS
* Set the default editor view to HTML

## Installation

Install the plugin by uploading the plugin folder to your wp-content/plugins directory. 

All settings are currently modified on activation and note ARE NOT reverted upon deactivation.
