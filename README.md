# ConcepticDesign Base Coat

A simple, boilerplate plugin to prepare new installs of Wordpress with my preferred settings. I also use it as a framework to develop plugins and add WP customizations.

## Features

* Removes avatars, month/year folders and xmlrpc
* Disables comments across the website
* Hooks in place both back/frontend functionality and adding custom CSS/JS

## Installation

Install the plugin by uploading the plugin folder to your wp-content/plugins directory. 

All settings are currently modified on activation and note ARE NOT reverted upon deactivation.
